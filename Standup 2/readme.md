## Test Cases
| **Test Case 1** |  |
|---|---|
| **Rationale** | When searching for a suitable, existing study group, the user needs to be able to view the results. Whether this be in either a list view or in a map view. This will be so that the user can easily filter, with map view being beneficial for location filtering, while list view being suitable for time and other fields. |
| **Goal** | The goal of the test case is to test whether the user can successfully use either (or both) views to show results. |
| **Steps to be performed** | 1. Instruct the user to perfom a filter to show existing study groups.|
| |2. Get the user to return recommended study groups in list view.|
| |3. Get the user to return recommended study groups in map view.|
| **Record Result** | Time taken to search|
| **Pass/Fail** | |
| **Pass:**| The user successfully applies approriate filters, and returns either map or list view (or both).|
| **Fail:**|Failure to complete the task without help|
| |There is a bug within the application|
