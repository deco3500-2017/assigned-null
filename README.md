## 1.0 Introduction 	
Education and technology evolve together constantly, with educational institutions making frequent use of computers and online learning platforms. However, there are still many problems that can be solved with innovative technologies. For example, University students often find it difficult to connect with other classmates to form study groups. They rarely speak to other students during lectures or practicals and even fewer make contact outside of class. The problem we have to solve is how we can allow users to create and find study groups in the easiest way possible. 

 For this course we have chosen the team name ‘assigned null’ and are required to create a solution to this problem using a mixture social and mobile technologies. The project that we selected for development is a location based study group finding application called “Study Mates”.


## 2.0 Concept

### 2.1 Rationale 	
Study Mates is a Mobile application that enables university students to connect with each other to study. It aims to address two issues that students face while at university, studying effectively and meeting like minded people. 

Common problems with studying include both procrastination and filling in gaps in understanding. People have struggled with procrastination going back to ancient civilisations. The Greek poet Hesiod, had cautioned not to “put your work off till tomorrow and the day after”, way back around 800 B.C. Given the rise of the internet and mobile devices it is clear that procrastination is as rampant as ever. While being alone you can always find ways to rationalise postponing the start of your study, i.e checking facebook, watching youtube while you eat. 

Study groups have been known to address the issue of procrastination while also providing plenty of benefits to participants. Studying alone can seem very monotonous and draining and it is often this idea that makes study unattractive by yourself. While studying in a group makes learning feel more enjoyable, fulfilling and engaging given its social nature. Another important benefit of group study is that it shares individual's unique talents and insights, allowing group members to learn from each other to fill in gaps in their knowledge. While those teaching, are able to reinforce their own knowledge.  

The benefit of study mates is that it makes it easy for students to form study groups to significantly improve their study habits while connecting like minded people to help create lasting connections.










### 2.2 Features
* Profile: user creates a profile, specifying courses they are taking. Campus they are on.
* A Student can start a study group by advertising their location and specifying what topic or area they wish to study and the duration. 
* Students are then able to search for groups by filtering on topic/subject area and enter that study group 
* Chat: chat feature lets students get more information about the study group before they join it to see if it is compatible with their timeline and the kind of study they wish to do. I.e Place, Timing, Content 
* Navigation: Through GPS to help students find their study group
* Notification: students can opt in to being notified when a study group for a course they are taking is available.  
* Security: communicate with universities so that students can only connect through active uni emails. Enables a sense of security for students as they know that only other university students are using the app. Also enables us to provide filtering features based on course codes.

### 2.3 Project Aims
* Develop a mobile prototype for study mates that enables students to engage in face to face study
* Allow students to form study groups in an ad-hoc manner 
* Investigate what tools can help facilitate study in groups and how they could be incorporated into the application 
* Interview target audience to discover insights into their study habits and when they would normally partake in group study


### 2.4 Audience 
The target audience for study mates is for tertiary level students.This is because the university environment supports group study by providing access to rooms and tables which groups can be stationed at. Also University can tend to isolate students as even if friends are attending the same university they may not be taking the same course, so finding new friends or groups to study can be difficult. Study mates helps bridge this by providing a platform that allows students to meet new people within their course.

### 2.5 Context of Use
Essentially the individual will use the app in a mobile setting as they will intend to meet up while on the go. Each individual has the ability to search for existing groups, or to create a new one. Location is integrated with the use of a map api, making use of the mobile gps to both share and find locations. Use







### 2.6 Prior Art

**GroupME -** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.groupme.android&hl=en 
GroupME is probably the biggest application now that is focused on forming groups with people with a total number of instances ranging from 10,000,000 - 50,000,000. It is a mobile application that is solely concerned with forming groups with your Family, Roommates, Friends, Coworkers, Teams, Bands or Faith Groups. Users are able to communicate to a group through a chat system that also enables sending images and videos. It seems that this app is more focused with forming groups with people the user already knows and doesn’t facilitate meeting up face to face. This is where it differs from study mates as our focus is targeted towards tertiary students and aims to bring people together who may not already know each other, face to face.

**Study Mate-timer, group study -** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=vh.frl.stopwatch&hl=en 
This application has a much smaller install base at 10,000 - 50 000 installs but focuses more on studying in an almost gamified manner. The app centred is around the idea of trying to do more study than others in your group. You can time the amount of study you do and by forming a group you can see the study statistics of everyone else in the group with the idea seeing how much study everyone else is doing will motivate you to study more.This idea is a different take on how to engage people with study in a collaborative way, by appealing to the more competitive nature of some people. Getting statistics of a user’s study habits might prove to be interesting feature to add to study mates but would require more research by interviewing our target audience to see if it is something that adds value to their experience.








### ////2.7 Social & Mobile Theory






## 3.0 Team 
**Equals null** consists of 4 members:  

**Daniel Burke**  

Daniel is pursuing Masters in IT (DECO7350) and he will be leading the team and will be responsible for managerial decisions of the project. He will be responsible for making the project plan and finalizing the features of our project, dividing the features into modules and assigning work for all team members each week. He will also be responsible for keeping track of the progress of the team and shall be point of contact for the tutors. He will also be working as a back-end developer and support the team in developing the project.  

**Jaymes Branch**  

Jaymes is pursuing his Bachelors in IT (Course Code: DECO3500) and he will be working as a front end and focusing on the UI/UX part of the project. He will also be responsible for the logistics of the project. He will be responsible for discussing with all team members and scheduling the weekly meeting, booking meeting rooms, set up immediate meeting if past meetings were missed (decide place/time) etc.  

**Shashank Gururaj**  

Shashank is pursuing his Masters in Computer Science (Management) (Course Code: DECO7350) and will be responsible for the designing the architecture of the product. His responsibilities include building the project architecture, selection of tools used for development etc. He will be also be working as a full stack developer and support the team in developing the project.  

**Wes Clarke**  

Wes is pursuing his Bachelors in Software Engineering (Course Code: DECO3500) and he will be responsible for the content of the writings of our project like project proposal, project report etc. He will also be working on the front-end developer and will be responsible for the UI Design of the project. 


### 3.1 Decision Making
Key decisions will be made during workshops and weekly catchup meetings. Decisions will be made based upon examining the ideas/feasibility/supporting documents. If every team member is not convinced by the idea, then decision will be made by voting within the team. The idea with most votes is to be proceeded with. The idea is then reviewed with one of the tutors (if it’s a key decision) and worked on upon approval/advises provided.
 
### 3.2 Minor Issues
If the team is lagging, initially the team will consult with one of the tutors to find the optimum way to correctly get to pace. The next plan would be for the team leader (Daniel) to set short and frequent milestones for each team member. Each member will update the team on the progress of the work twice a week. If one of the team members is unavailable to work on the project for a duration, then the other 3 members divide the person’s work and complete it within a deadline.
 


### 3.3 Resolving Conflicts
When a conflict arises within the team, all the team members meet to resolve the conflict. If everyone cannot meet at the same place and the conflict needs urgent attention, then all the team member connects through skype/facetime to resolve the conflict. The views of each member involved in the conflict will be examined/discussed. If the conflict cannot be solved within the team, we shall seek the help of the tutors. Precautions shall be taken to avoid miscommunication which can lead into conflicts (making sure everybody is on the same page during meetings). 


## 4.0 Communication 
### 4.1 Communication methods
Communication outside workshops will be done in weekly meetings which are scheduled on Tuesdays at 3-4pm at General Purpose South Building, Room 207. If the team is unable to meet on the scheduled time/place. Possibility of meeting and place/time of next meeting is discussed. If everyone in the team is unable to meet physically, then a conference call shall be setup using skype/facetime and the proceedings shall be discussed. Facebook Messenger group is used as the main channel for communication. Flies will be shared through Google Docs. Each file that is uploaded with be name with the following convention: “MemberName_AssignmentName_ModifiedDate_UpdatedTopic”
 
### 4.2 Reason for choice of Social Platforms
Facebook messenger is a very popular convenient way to communicate by allowing its users to add documents/media into the chat which can help in providing better explanations. Most people have been using it and familiar with it. Google docs has been chosen for file sharing due to 2 main reasons. One being that it is integrated with google drive which allows its users to create multiple folders and has a huge storage space. The Folder structure is like windows folder structure and easy to understand/modify. It is very easy to share a folder or file with multiple people. Second is that a file on google docs can be updated simultaneously by 2 or more people whom it is shared with. This prevents multiple files being created and the hassle of integrating them.

### 5.1 Plan overview
Our Project will be development will consist of 3 main phases:
* Requirement Gathering and Analysis
* Design
* Construction

Requirement gathering and Analysis: Here we finalize the features and analyze the requirements and document the analysis. This will be achieved by conducting interviews with our target audience to identify what incentives group study among students and what tools they need to help them achieve this. This will also help us identify any pain points students have with group study. We will also be analysing various prototyping tools and selecting those which we believe to be most appropriate.
The deadline for this phase is week 8.

Design: Here we build the high level and low-level designs of the project and document the same. The deadline for this phase is week 10. This also requires collaboration between or front-end and back-end developers to coordinate the integration of these parts for a seamless integration.
The deadline for this phase is week 10

Construction: The prototype shall be built in the phase and document the same. and documentation for the same. Once the prototype has been implemented, time will be available to refine the implementation. This will be conducted with further user testing if time permits or in-house testing to help finalise the implementation. 
 The deadline for this phase is week 12.
