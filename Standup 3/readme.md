Changes: 
1. Colour coded markers to indicate whether groups were currently active or scheduled for a later time
	Also added a legend to help explain the icons
- This was added as user testing found users wanted to be able to tell the timeliness of study groups before getting more infomation
2. Added option to group creation to automatically repeat meeting times
- User testing found that our users prefer to schedule their meetings over more adhoc means, this can make that easier.
3. Can now access previous groups that the user has joined, they can schedule meetings, chat with the group members or choose to leave the group
- Some users seemed inclined to want to keep in contact with groups they have joined, particulary if they find that a group was really good to study with
