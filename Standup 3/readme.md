Added meetings to the digital prototype for user interaction.
To test user interaction, a total of 25 markers are placed at random on the map, containing the meeting information.
The information includes the meeting ID, the start and end times, current group size.
After user testing, this was refined to be updated to include a group name, building/room number and a short description as users found the explanation was lacking.
A legend is required to inform the user as to the colours of markers.
It is not evident that markers are clickable, refinement will need to be made to make this clear to the user

## Marvel Prototype - Wes Clarke

Changes: 
1. Colour coded markers to indicate whether groups were currently active or scheduled for a later time
	Also added a legend to help explain the icons
- This was added as user testing found users wanted to be able to tell the timeliness of study groups before getting more infomation
2. Added option to group creation to automatically repeat meeting times
- User testing found that our users prefer to schedule their meetings over more adhoc means, this can make that easier.
3. Can now access previous groups that the user has joined, they can schedule meetings, chat with the group members or choose to leave the group
- Some users seemed inclined to want to keep in contact with groups they have joined, particulary if they find that a group was really good to study with

User run-throughs 

I gave three random people the interactive prototype and asked them to do specific tasks which i roughly timed in non-lab conditions. I then asked a few questions that i thought would be helpful to gather feedback in this context. They were given a brief overview of what the application was supposed to do.
Tasks
Access the map filter: Average time 4 seconds.
Reduce the course search to “Discrete Maths”: AVG 11 seconds.
Set the time for now, have it end in an hour and submit: AVG 25 seconds.
Select an ongoing study group: AVG 8 seconds.
Go to your profile: 6 seconds.
Sign out: 4 seconds.

User feedback
All of them found the website to be aesthetically pleasing, the response was positive aside from the yellow bars on the profile page.
At the time, we were planning to use a tutorial system to demonstrate the meaning of different colours. However the testers much preferred the idea of a map legend, this was implemented by the team soon afterwards.
The time inputs add a colon after four numeric inputs. However, many users added only three (01:30 vs 1:30) which slowed the process down. This was labelled as a problem to address.
1 of the 3 users found did not initially realise the coloured dots were clickable. Perhaps google map pins would be more recognisable, requires more testing.
Highlight on click may be a good idea for better user feedback, since the application is mobile a hover highlight is impractical.
Two of the three felt they would be more likely to create an event later in the day, rather than ASAP.

Created the create group page, map filter and legend.
